Start with q4trap.pyThis is simply the trapezium script given in the work sheet.It allows you to play around with n, the number of trapeziums.q4work.py is work up to question Q4.4The plot files are useful scripts for plotting integrands(without any integration)I think these are useful for seeing what range is good to integrate over.q4pendulum.py is an attempt to do Q4.7 and q4.8but I haven't got very far with this.I'm not sure how best to use alpha as a parameter.Although there aren't any marks for 4.6, I strongly recommend you do itas SciPy looks like a really useful library and I'm sure you'll be using it in the future.
