c4 - 2 Prep

1. 

* gives to address of a variable or can be null.
When pointing to an address, the variable can be modified from within another function.
& gives a reference to a variable.  It behaves like a pointer but cannot be null.

2. 

c4_prep_2.c

# include <stdio.h>

// fn changes value of x by reference
void fn(int& x) {
  x = 23;
}

int main () {

  int x = 5;
  printf("%d\n", x);
  fn(x);
  printf("%d\n", x);
}

3.

FILE declares a (pointer to a) file.
fopen opens a file for reading or writing
fclose closes an open file so that reading or writing can no longer be performed.
fgetc reads a single character (i.e. one byte) from an open file.
EOF is a byte indicating the end of a file

4. 

c4_prep_4.c

# include <stdio.h>

int main () {

  FILE *fp;

  fp = fopen("c4_prep_4.txt", "r");

  char c = fgetc(fp);
  while(c != EOF) {
    printf("%c", c);
    c = fgetc(fp);
  }
  fclose(fp);
}

This reads from the text file:
c4_prep_4.txt

This is a text file.
For testing.


5. 

isalpha() checks if a character is an alphabetic character, i.e. a-z or A-Z
Returns a non-zero integer if it is, otherwise 0.

toupper() converts a character to upper case if it is lower case, otherwise it remains unchanged.

Both these functions are in the <ctype.h> library.

6. 

A is ASCII code 65.
